This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the api directory, you can run:

### `flask run`

to begin the backend server.

In the client directory, you can run:

### `npm run debug-start`

This will begin the front-end server, launching the React application in a new window.
